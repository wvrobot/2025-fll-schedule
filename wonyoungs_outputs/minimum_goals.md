- Above worse/average metrics met or exceeded
- Only 1 team with imperfect opponent scores (plays table round alone)
- Team with the worst break times = 58408
    - Worst time = Judging1 -> Practice1 (10:30-10:50 = 20 minutes)
- Team with second worst = 59826
    - Worst time = Judging1 -> Practice1 (10:30-10:39 = 9 minutes)
    - Potential swaps I found: swap with team 3703 at cost of location consistency
